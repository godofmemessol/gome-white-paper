## 1. Introduction

GOME is a launchpad platform built on the Solana blockchain aiming to facilitate the creation and launch of meme tokens. This white paper is designed to introduce the objectives, functionalities, and potential impacts of the platform on the ecosystem.

## 2. Problem

Creating and launching meme tokens on traditional blockchain platforms is often complex and costly. Additionally, existing platforms are often limited by high gas fees and slow transaction speeds, creating an unfavorable environment for meme tokens.
